# Threat Modeling Manifesto
Threat modeling is a process of analyzing a system to identify security and privacy concerns. It involves four key questions: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job? This process helps recognize potential issues and informs decisions throughout a system's development.

Anyone concerned about system privacy and security should engage in threat modeling. The Threat Modeling Manifesto provides guidance for developing a methodology tailored to specific needs. It emphasizes values like finding and fixing design issues, collaboration, and continuous improvement, while its principles highlight the importance of early and frequent analysis aligned with development practices and meaningful outcomes for stakeholders.

In summary, threat modeling is a crucial practice for enhancing system security and privacy, applicable to everyone, and the Threat Modeling Manifesto offers valuable guidance based on core values and principles.
