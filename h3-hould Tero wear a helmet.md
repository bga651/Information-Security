# Threat Modeling Manifesto
Threat modeling is a process of analyzing a system to identify security and privacy concerns. It involves four key questions: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job? This process helps recognize potential issues and informs decisions throughout a system's development.

Anyone concerned about system privacy and security should engage in threat modeling. The Threat Modeling Manifesto provides guidance for developing a methodology tailored to specific needs. It emphasizes values like finding and fixing design issues, collaboration, and continuous improvement, while its principles highlight the importance of early and frequent analysis aligned with development practices and meaningful outcomes for stakeholders.

In summary, threat modeling is a crucial practice for enhancing system security and privacy, applicable to everyone, and the Threat Modeling Manifesto offers valuable guidance based on core values and principles.

Assess threats holistically
Often, a threat to one resource may result in an indirect threat to downstream resources. For example, if an attacker compromises an application, a threat to the application may also compromise the data the application accesses.

For this reason, it is important to assess threats holistically rather than in isolation. Assess the potential severity of each threat not only in terms of the primary resources it threatens, but also in terms of the overall damage it could cause to the business.

Likewise, measures need to be taken to mitigate threats at multiple levels. For example, if a threat to application security causes collateral damage to data security, you can take steps in the application and data to help mitigate the threat. You may need to implement two-factor authentication on your application to reduce the risk of a breach, and also implement off-site backups of your data so that if an application breach allows an attacker to access your data, you have a clean copy to deny Ransom extortion.

Think holistically about threats
It might sound reasonable to focus your threat modeling on threats related to recent high-profile attacks, or threats your business has faced in the past. However, the best threat modeling strategies need to cover every threat that could impact the businessâ€”regardless of its newsworthiness or whether it has translated into a real-world attack in the past. When identifying threats, check not only cybersecurity blogs for recent breaches, but also threat databases and threat intelligence reports to gain insight into the types of threats your team may not otherwise consider.
