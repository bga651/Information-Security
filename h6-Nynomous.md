# Summarise: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
The article discusses seven key things that individuals should know about Tor, a privacy-focused network known for providing anonymity online.

1. Tor Still Works: Despite NSA revelations about attempts to compromise it, Tor remains an effective tool for online anonymity. While certain users have been compromised through exploits or misconfigurations, the core cryptographic protection of Tor appears to remain intact. However, it cannot prevent monitoring if both ends of the communication are actively surveilled.

2. Tor is Not Only Used by Criminals: A common misconception is that Tor is exclusively used by criminals and pedophiles. In reality, Tor serves various purposes, including circumventing censorship, secure military communications, protecting families, aiding journalists, and more. It can even help users protect against criminal tactics like identity theft.

3. Tor Does Not Have a Military Backdoor: Although initially funded by the US Navy, Tor's code has been scrutinized by security experts and cryptographers, confirming there is no hidden military backdoor. It is an open-source project developed by privacy and anonymity-focused activists.

4. No One in the US Has Been Prosecuted For Running a Tor Relay: As per the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), no one in the US has faced prosecution for running a Tor relay. While running an exit relay may attract law enforcement attention, EFF believes that running a relay is generally not illegal in the United States. However, engaging in criminal activities through Tor may lead to legal consequences.

5. Tor is Easy to Use: Contrary to the perception that privacy software is complex, Tor offers user-friendly options like the Tor Browser Bundle, preconfigured for secure Tor usage. Tails, a live operating system that routes all internet traffic through Tor, is another easy-to-use option.

6. Tor is Not as Slow as You Think: Although Tor may be slower than regular internet connections, ongoing efforts by Tor developers aim to enhance its speed. Expanding the network by creating more relays is one way to contribute to improving its speed.

7. Tor is Not Foolproof: Tor's effectiveness depends on correct usage. Users should stick to recommended tools like the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails and keep their software up to date. Logging into services like Google and Facebook via Tor may still allow these services to view your communications within their systems. Additionally, adversaries with access to both sides of the connection could potentially perform statistical analysis to identify the user.

In conclusion, Tor remains a robust anonymity tool, dispelling misconceptions that it is exclusively for criminals or has military backdoors. It offers user-friendly options, is continually improving in speed, and, while not foolproof, provides strong anonymity when used correctly. Educating the public about Tor's capabilities can help individuals take back their online privacy.
